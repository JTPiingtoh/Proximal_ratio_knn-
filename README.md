Implementing novel KNN-models from "Effective k‑nearest neighbor models for data
classification enhancement".

This repository contains a PRKNNClassifier python class, which implements a sci-kit learn API complient implentation of the proximal ratio (PR) KNN models described in the paper above. The PRKNNClassifier can be found in test_class.py.

In review.ipynb, I describe how the models work, and try to replicate some of the results the creators of this model obtained from experiment 1 of their paper. I also discuss some critiques I have for how the paper details the implementation of the PRKNN model.

Implementing the model presented some technical challenges, also discussed in review.ipynb

In demo.ipynb, , discuss some of the challanges I encountered while implementing them.



This project is still ongoing, as I look to optimize the performance of the PRKNNClassifier.
